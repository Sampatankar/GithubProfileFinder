# GithubProfileFinder
Basic GitHub profile finder

This project is based on a tutorial in the Modern JavaScript Course by Brad Traversy via Udemy.com

The point will be to use ES6 and later vanilla JavaScript, to access GitHub via it's API, and search for profiles.

The UI is built on BootSwatch, which utilises Bootstrap4 and as such requires BS4s' CDNs.
